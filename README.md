# Fediweb
The fediverse is an ensemble of federated (i.e. interconnected) servers that are used for web publishing and file hosting, but which, while independently hosted, can communicate with each other. The Fediverse is decentralized and has no central point of control, so if one platform is taken down, the rest of the Fediverse survives.
